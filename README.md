# Air Compressor Data Classification Demo

This demo shows the full deep learning workflow for an example of signal data. We show how to prepare, model, and deploy a deep learning based classification algorithm to identify the condition or output of a mechanical air compressor.

## Special Instructions

This demo is implemented as a MATLAB project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need. 

There is also a significant data download required the first time you run the project, which is licensed by Nishchal K. Verma, R. K. Sevakula, S. Dixit and A. Salour and subject to the license terms found in AirCompressorDataset.rights.  When you open the project, it will ask you where to put this data.  Select a folder, nominally outside of the project root, and it will download to there.
